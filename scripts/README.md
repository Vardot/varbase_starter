## Change the list of users and their passwords
* Edit the `users` array in `add-testing-users.sh` and `delete-testing-users.sh`.
* Each entry follows the format: `"name|mail|password|role"`
* Add more users or change the password for the listed users.

## Wire a Drupal CMS project for Varbase Starter

Varbase Starter is a `Site` recipe, so it is not tied to Varbase. On a Varbase 11 base
(`drupal/varbase_project`) nothing extra is needed. A plain `drupal/cms` codebase is
missing the composer and npm wiring Varbase ships, and `composer require drupal/varbase_starter`
fails on it before the recipe is ever downloaded.

`drupal-cms-wiring.php` adds all of it. It is idempotent, reports what it changed, and
takes `--dry-run`.

```
cd PROJECT_DIR_NAME/recipes/varbase_starter/scripts
php drupal-cms-wiring.php
```

Run it from the project root instead and it will find the root itself.

What it merges in comes from two editable asset files, so changing the wiring never
means editing the script:

* `scripts/assets/drupal-cms.composer.json` is merged into the root `composer.json`
* `scripts/assets/drupal-libraries.package.json` is merged into the root `package.json`

Both merges are additive: every leaf is set, existing sibling keys are left alone, and
re-running reports what was already in place.

What it sets:

* `minimum-stability: dev` + `prefer-stable: true` — every `drupal/varbase_*_base` it requires is `1.0.x-dev` and `drupal/vartheme_bs5` is `5.0.x-dev`,
  against `drupal/cms`'s `stable`.
* `config.allow-plugins` for `cweagans/composer-patches`, `vardot/varbase-patches` and
  `oomphinc/composer-installers-extender` — varbase-patches is a plugin and pulls the
  extender in, and `drupal/cms` allows neither, so composer aborts its install step.
* `extra.enable-patching`, `extra.composer-exit-on-patch-failure` and the default-deny
  `extra.composer-patches.allowed-dependency-patches` allowlist — this is what lets
  `drupal/canvas` resolve with its patches.
* the `drupal-libraries` block in `package.json` plus the `postinstall` hook, and copies
  `drupal-libraries-sync.js` to the project root's `scripts/`.
* `.yarnrc.yml` with `nodeLinker: node-modules` — Yarn 4 defaults to Plug'n'Play and
  writes no `node_modules/` for the sync script to copy from.

Then, from the project root:

```
composer require drupal/varbase_starter -W
corepack enable && corepack yarn install
```

`vardot/varbase-patches` arrives as a requirement of this recipe, so it does not need
requiring separately: the wiring above only has to permit its plugin first.

`-W` is required: a partial update keeps the locked `symfony/css-selector`, which
`drupal/storybook` (via `varbase_dev_base`) conflicts with.

Known limit: this produces a working codebase, but on a plain Drupal CMS base the
install itself currently fails in the recipe config batch for a reason outside this
recipe — `drupal_cms_search` clones every node view display and Drupal CMS installs
`layout_builder`, so dependency calculation hits a null field definition. Varbase 11 is
the supported base today.
